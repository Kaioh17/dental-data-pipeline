# Project Overview
This project is focused on building a set of Python libraries to connect and manage various databases. These libraries will enable users to perform data copying, minimization, and sanitization. The goal is to provide a flexible and cost-effective solution for data transformation, offering essential features like security and ease of use.

By the end of the project, the libraries will be hosted on GitHub, allowing public access and contribution. The libraries will also include relevant documentation to help users implement these features in their own systems.

Key Features:
   Data copying and synchronization between databases
   
   Data minimization and sanitization techniques for sensitive information
   
   Integration with relational and non-relational databases (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB)
   
   Customizable tools for data transformation, obfuscation, and masking
  
   Open-source and free for use

Competitor Analysis:
We reviewed a few existing tools in the market to identify their strengths and weaknesses. Below is a comparison of popular tools:

1. Tonic.AI
 Pros:
 
 Strong anonymization and AI-driven data masking
 
 Excellent for protecting sensitive information while maintaining usability for analytics
 
 Cons:
 
 Expensive, geared towards large enterprises
 
 Not open-source

2. Redgate SQL Clone
 Pros:
 
 Fast database cloning, enabling quick setup and rollback of database copies
 
 Great for development and testing environments
 
 Cons:
 
 Limited to SQL Server
 
 Pricing may be a concern for smaller teams or individual developers

3. Delphix
Pros:

Data masking and virtualization for efficient data management

Good for complex enterprise environments

Cons:

Setup and configuration are complex

Enterprise-level pricing

Our Solution
Our custom tool aims to provide a flexible, open-source solution for secure data management that can be easily integrated into different database systems. We focus on:

Affordability: Accessible to a wider range of users, especially small businesses and individual developers.

Flexibility: Supporting both relational and non-relational databases.

Simplicity: An easy-to-use interface and setup process.
